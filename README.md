# Max-Payne-1-Crosshair-Mod

I created this mod because the game's original crosshair dot was too small and almost invisible.
I used assets from Darkje's 'proof of concept' crosshair mod to create my own version of a crosshair mod that makes the crosshair easily visible and useable.
I have also upscaled the weapon name/text assets of all in-game weapons to make them more consistent with the font used for the ammo amount.
This mod works on 16:9 aspect ratio with Widescreen Patch. I am uncertain if it will work on different aspect ratios because I haven't tested it.

I highly recommend using this mod together with the following mod, otherwise this mod might not work properly:
